# Dev-Board

Dev-Board was created in order to manage multiple projects ideas and To do over a long period of time. The main board is divided into 4 categories :

- Ideas and To do
- In Progress
- Completed
- Abandoned

The cards created can be dragged from one category to another. The cards placed in the Completed category will be moved into the archive. Tha cards placed in the Abandoned category will be moved in the Trash. The time before cards move can be ajusted to one of these settings :

- 30 days (Default value) 
- 60 days
- 90 days

The cards present in the Archive can be dearchived and returned back in the Completed category for another period of 30, 60 or 90 days if they are left into that category. The same thing can be done with the cards  in the Trash, but they will be restored into the Abandoned category.

Please note that I don't have a computer with Window installed or a Mac computer. So you might enconter some problems compiling for Windows or Mac.
